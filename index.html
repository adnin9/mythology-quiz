                <p id="textA">Orpheus, a gifted musician, fell deeply in love with Eurydice, and they celebrated their wedding joyfully. Tragedy struck when Eurydice was bitten by a venomous snake and died.
                     Grief-stricken, Orpheus decided to journey to the Underworld to retrieve his beloved. Armed with his enchanting music, he charmed the gods and gained permission to bring Eurydice back,
                     but there was a condition: he must not look back until they reached the surface. In his overwhelming anticipation, Orpheus couldn't resist glancing back, and Eurydice vanished forever.
                     Heartbroken, Orpheus wandered the earth in sorrow, playing mournful tunes that moved even the rocks and trees. Eventually, he encountered a group of frenzied women, the Maenads, who disapproved of his grief.
                     In their fury, they tore Orpheus apart, ending his poignant melodies. The Muses gathered his remains and gave him a proper burial. Orpheus and Eurydice's tragic love story became a timeless tale of love, loss,
                     and the consequences of succumbing to impatience and doubt.</p>
